# Hydration and Athletic Performance: The Overlooked Key to Success

In the pursuit of peak athletic performance, <b>hydration</b> is often overlooked despite its critical role.  
Dehydration, even mild, can significantly impair physical and cognitive function, making the difference between a personal best and a disappointing outcome.  

This article explores the <b>science of hydration</b> and practical strategies for athletes.

## Why is Hydration So Important?

Water makes up a significant portion of our body weight and is vital for countless physiological processes, including:

- <b>Regulating body temperature</b>  
- <b>Transporting nutrients and oxygen</b>  
- <b>Lubricating joints</b>  
- <b>Removing waste products</b>  

During exercise, fluid loss through sweat increases dramatically, making consistent hydration crucial.

## Signs and Symptoms of Dehydration

It’s important to recognize the early signs of dehydration before performance is affected:

- <b>Thirst</b> (often a late indicator)  
- <b>Fatigue and lethargy</b>  
- <b>Dizziness or lightheadedness</b>  
- <b>Decreased urine output</b> (darker urine color)  
- <b>Muscle cramps</b>

## Practical Hydration Strategies for Athletes

Optimizing hydration requires a strategic approach <b>before, during, and after</b> training or competition:

1. <b>Pre-exercise Hydration</b>  
   Drink 500–600 ml of water 2–4 hours before exercise, and another 200–300 ml 10–20 minutes beforehand.  

2. <b>During Exercise</b>  
   Aim for 150–250 ml every 15–20 minutes, adjusting based on sweat rate and environmental conditions.  
   For sessions longer than 60 minutes or in hot conditions, consider a sports drink with electrolytes.  

3. <b>Post-exercise Rehydration</b>  
   Replenish fluids by drinking 1.25–1.5 liters of fluid for every 1 kg of body weight lost during exercise.  
   Include sodium to aid fluid retention.
