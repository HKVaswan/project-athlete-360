                <h2>The Spark Behind the Mission</h2>
                <p>This journey began not in a boardroom, but on a dusty field with a single, talented young athlete who had nowhere to go. Their potential was undeniable, but the path forward was invisible‚Äîblocked by a lack of guidance, resources, and opportunity. That frustration was the seed for Project Athlete 360: a promise to build the system we wish we had.</p>
