The Forgotten Fuel: Hydration <br>

In the pursuit of peak athletic performance, hydration is often overlooked despite its critical role. Dehydration, even mild, can significantly impair physical and cognitive function, making the difference between a personal best and a disappointing outcome. This post will explore the science of hydration and practical strategies for athletes.<br>

<br>

Why is Hydration so Important?<br>

Water makes up a significant portion of our body weight and is vital for countless physiological processes, including:<br>

<br>

•Regulating body temperature<br>
•Transporting nutrients and oxygen<br>
•Lubricating joints<br>
•Removing waste products<br>

<br>

During exercise, fluid loss through sweat increases dramatically, making consistent hydration crucial.<br>

<br>

Signs and Symptoms of Dehydration<br>

It's important to recognize the early signs of dehydration before performance is affected:<br>

<br>

•Thirst (often a late indicator)<br>
•Fatigue and lethargy<br>
•Dizziness or lightheadedness<br>
•Decreased urine output (darker urine color)<br>
•Muscle cramps<br>

<br>

Practical Hydration Strategies for Athletes<br>

Optimizing hydration requires a strategic approach before, during, and after training or competition:<br>

<br>

Pre-exercise Hydration: Drink 500-600 ml of water 2-4 hours before exercise, and another 200-300 ml 10-20 minutes beforehand.<br>

During Exercise: Aim for 150-250 ml every 15-20 minutes, adjusting based on sweat rate and environmental conditions. For sessions longer than 60 minutes or in hot conditions, consider a sports drink with electrolytes.<br>

Post-exercise Rehydration: Replenish fluids by drinking 1.25-1.5 liters of fluid for every 1 kg of body weight lost during exercise. Include sodium to aid fluid retention.<br>
