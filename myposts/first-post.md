The Unseen Epidemic: ACL Injuries
In the high-stakes world of Indian football, where every sprint and pivot counts, one injury looms large: the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. This debilitating injury can sideline athletes for a full season, and its prevalence in our athletes is a growing concern. This article dives into the science behind ACL injuries and shares actionable strategies for prevention.

What is the ACL?
The ACL is a critical ligament in the knee that provides stability. It connects the thigh bone to the shin bone, preventing the shin from sliding forward during sudden movements. Injuries often occur without contact, such as when an athlete performs a non-contact cutting motion, a sudden stop, or an awkward landing from a jump.
Why are they so common?
Research indicates several factors contribute to a higher rate of ACL injuries in certain sports, including:
•Neuromuscular imbalances: Weakness in the hamstrings compared to the quadriceps.
•Biomechanical issues: Poor landing mechanics or an improper cutting motion.
•Previous injury history: Athletes with a prior injury are at a higher risk.
We need to address these issues holistically.Prevention is KeyPreventing an ACL tear is far better than treating one. 
Here are some evidence-first prevention strategies:Strength and Conditioning: Focus on building strength in the hamstrings, glutes, and core.
Plyometric Training: Incorporate drills that teach proper landing and deceleration techniques.Proprioceptive Training: Use balance boards and single-leg exercises to improve joint awareness and stability.For more information, please consult a certified sports physiotherapist. 
The goal is to move from reactive treatment to proactive prevention.Our work here at Project Athlete 360 is to turn rigorous knowledge into everyday improvements on the field, and this is a perfect example of that mission.This is a guest post by Dr. Anika Sharma.
