# ACL Injuries in Indian Football: Understanding & Preventing the Threat <br>
<br>
In the high-stakes world of Indian football, where every sprint and pivot counts, one injury looms large: the <b>anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear</b>.  <br>
This debilitating injury can sideline athletes for a full season, and its prevalence in our athletes is a growing concern.  <br>

This article dives into the science behind ACL injuries and shares <b>actionable strategies for prevention</b>. <br>

<br>

## What is the ACL?

The <b>ACL</b> is a critical ligament in the knee that provides stability.  <br>
It connects the thigh bone to the shin bone, preventing the shin from sliding forward during sudden movements.  <br>

Injuries often occur without contact — for example:  <br>
* A non-contact cutting motion  <br>
* A sudden stop  <br>
* An awkward landing from a jump  <br>

<br>

## Why Are ACL Injuries So Common?<br>

Research indicates several factors contribute to a higher rate of ACL injuries in certain sports, including:<br>

- <b>Neuromuscular imbalances</b>: Weakness in the hamstrings compared to the quadriceps  <br>
- <b>Biomechanical issues</b>: Poor landing mechanics or improper cutting motion  <br>
- <b>Previous injury history</b>: Athletes with a prior injury are at a higher risk  <br>

<br>

## Prevention Is Key<br>

Preventing an ACL tear is far better than treating one.  <br>
Here are some <b>evidence-first prevention strategies</b>:<br>

1. <b>Strength and Conditioning</b>  <br>
   Focus on building strength in the hamstrings, glutes, and core.  <br>

2. <b>Plyometric Training</b>  <br>
   Incorporate drills that teach proper landing and deceleration techniques.  <br>

3. <b>Proprioceptive Training</b>  <br>
   Use balance boards and single-leg exercises to improve joint awareness and stability.  <br>

## Final Thoughts

The goal is to move from <b>reactive treatment</b> to <b>proactive prevention</b>.  

Our work here at <b>Project Athlete 360</b> is to turn rigorous knowledge into everyday improvements on the field, and this is a perfect example of that mission.
