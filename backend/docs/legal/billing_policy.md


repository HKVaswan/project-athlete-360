## ⚙️ 3. Overage & Usage-Based Billing

### 3.1 Overage Definition
Overage occurs when an institution or user exceeds allocated:
- Storage capacity (e.g., GB per plan)
- API or data request quotas
- Athlete or coach seat limits

### 3.2 Detection & Enforcement
- Overage is monitored continuously by the **overage.service.ts** and **planMonitor.worker.ts**.  
- If sustained usage exceeds limits for **>24 hours**, the system may:
  1. Notify via email and dashboard warnings.  
  2. Automatically charge additional usage fees (based on configured overage rates).  
  3. Enforce temporary feature restrictions if payment fails.  

### 3.3 Transparency
All plan limits and overage rates are displayed on:
- [https://projectathlete360.com/pricing](https://projectathlete360.com/pricing)  
- Within the user dashboard → *Billing > Plan Details*
